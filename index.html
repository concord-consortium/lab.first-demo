    <p>Molecular Workbench is already one of the most versatile ways to experience the science of atoms and molecules. Now thanks to Google's generosity and the power of HTML5, we're bringing it to Web browsers everywhere.</p>
    <h2>Try It Out</h2>
    <p>We're taking our first steps with the fully operational model at right. Yup â€“ no movies or animations. Just pure, research-grade molecular simulation. So go ahead and play. Please.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heat and cool the model. Can you make all the atoms clump together? Can you make them fly around?</li>
      <li>Adjust the slider to change the attractive force between atoms. What happens?</li>
      <li>Turn on Coulomb forces to give the atoms charge. How does their behavior change? Do clumps of atoms look different when the atoms have charges?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Is MW?</h2>
    <p>MW is powerful software that provides visual, interactive computational experiments for teaching and learning science. Over the past decade, we've developed our Classic MW into one of the most amazing tools for science teaching and learning.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="browser">
    <h2>Now in the Browser</h2>
    <p>We think MW deserves to thrive. To reach as many learners as humanly possible. On pocket devices or computers, whatever's available. So we're building the next-generation MW to capture the amazing power and flexibility of modern Web browsers.</p>

    <h2>Learn More</h2>
    <p>Plenty of exciting developments are still to come on this page and on Github. So follow our tweets and posts, and subscribe to learn more.</p>
  </div>
  <p id="browser-note">The HTML model will work in any modern browser, but currently performs best in the latest version of Google Chrome.</p>

      <h2>Classic MW</h2>
      <p>Classic MW is alive and well, with hundreds of free models you can use right now. These can be used as-is, but there are also hundreds of classroom-tested learning activities based on MW for all levels of science and engineering. See mw.concord.org/modeler and molo.concord.org/database</p>

      <p><strong>First Demo of HTML5 Molecular Model</strong><br />
      Here's a demo of our initial work re-creating part of our Java application Molecular Workbench in HTML5. This model is a computational simulation of a collection of 50 simple charged atoms. Read more &raquo;</p>
